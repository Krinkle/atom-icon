# Atom replacement icon

![replacement icon](atom-new.png)

This small script replaces the default icon for atom and atom beta on MacOS.
No symlinks, no special stuff. Should just work and if it doesn't file a PR.

It out of frustration using the [atom icon replacement][1] project which
doesn't support Atom Beta and for some reason just messes things up for me.

PR for Windows and Linux welcome - reviews will be opinionated.
