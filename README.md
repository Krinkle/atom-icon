# Atom replacement icon

![replacement icon](atom-new.png)

This small script replaces the default icon for atom and atom beta on MacOS. No symlinks, no special stuff. Should just work and if it doesn't file a PR.

It grew out of frustration using the [atom icon replacement][1] project which doesn't support Atom Beta and for some reason just messes things up for me.

PR for Windows and Linux welcome - reviews will be opinionated.


## Installation

```console
$ ./install.sh
```

Note: you'll have to run this every time atom updates since the updated bundle contains the old icon.
